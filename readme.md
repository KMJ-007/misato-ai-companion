## Installation:
 1. Install Python 3.10.5 if you don't already have it installed.
 2. clone the repository using `git clone `

# ps:
code is written in little rush because of the hackathon's little time, if you find any crappy or code which don't make any kind of sense, i think i can explain, contact me!, will document and fix it in future
